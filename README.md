# NodeJS Starter Samples
NodeJS Starter Samples is a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) project based on [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework, which consists of demos. It is a good practice to learn new techniques through samples. This project aims to show very basic features and it is a quick guide to learn NodeJS. In order to focus on NodeJS itself, the code is made as simple as possible.
[Pug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug) is used as default template engine. Pug fully integrates with Express, a popular Node.js web framework, as a supported view engine. Check out Express’s excellent [guide](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html) for how to integrate Pug with Express.
## Audience
This project is a set of samples for NodeJS beginners. Basic HTML, CSS and Javascript knowledge is required. What a beginner cares about is how the source code is organized, and where the program entrance is.

* Install Express
`$ npm install express --save`
