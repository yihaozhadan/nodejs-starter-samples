# Pug View Engine
This sample shows basic ExpressJS working with Pug view engine. [Pug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug) is used as default template engine. Pug fully integrates with Express, a popular Node.js web framework, as a supported view engine. Check out Express’s excellent [guide](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html) for how to integrate Pug with Express.

## Requirements

  * Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4.0 or newer
  * `npm` v3.3 or newer (new to [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/)?)
  * Text editor or IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Directory Layout

Before you start, take a moment to see how the project structure looks like:

```
├── /bin/                       # The folder for compiled output
├── /docs/                      # Documentation files for the project
├── /node_modules/              # 3rd-party libraries and utilities
├── /public/                    # Static files which are used for client side
├── /routes/                    # Express routing information
├── /views/                     # Front pages 
├── app.js                      # Server-side startup script
└── package.json                # The list of 3rd party libraries and utilities
```

## Getting Started
